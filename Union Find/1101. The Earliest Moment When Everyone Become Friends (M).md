## 1101. The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends (M) - Union Find

There are n people in a social group labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an array `logs` where `logs[i] = [timestampi, xi, yi]` indicates that `xi` and `yi` will be friends at the time `timestampi`.

Friendship is **symmetric**. That means if `a` is friends with `b`, then `b` is friends with `a`. Also, person `a` is acquainted with a person `b` if `a` is friends with `b`, or `a` is a friend of someone acquainted with `b`.

Return *the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person*. If there is no such earliest time, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], n = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation: 
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101, and after 0 and 1 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104, and after 3 and 4 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].
The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107, and after 2 and 3 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].
The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211, and after 1 and 5 become friends, we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].
The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224, and as 2 and 4 are already friends, nothing happens.
The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301, and after 0 and 3 become friends, we all become friends.
```



### Solution - Union Find

- For every two person, we perform `union` on them. 
  - Return `true` to indicate they are merged into one group, `false` to indicate that they are already belong to one group

```python
class Solution(object):
    def earliestAcq(self, logs, n):
        """
        :type logs: List[List[int]]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        logs.sort()
        groupcount = n
        self.father = {i:i for i in range(n)}
        for ts, p1, p2 in logs:
            if self.union(p1, p2):
                groupcount -= 1
            if groupcount == 1:
                return ts
        return -1

    def find(self, node):
        if self.father[node] != node:
            self.father[node] = self.find(self.father[node])
        return self.father[node]
    
    def union(self, a, b):
        fa, fb = self.find(a), self.find(b)
        if fa != fb:
            self.father[fb] = fa
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
