## 685. Redundant Connection II (H)

In this problem, a rooted tree is a **directed** graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with `n` nodes (with distinct values from `1` to `n`), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of `edges`. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[ui, vi]` that represents a **directed** edge connecting nodes `ui` and `vi`, where `ui` is a parent of child `vi`.

Return *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of* `n` *nodes*. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5]]
Output: [4,1]

### Solution - Union Find

Identify the redundant edge by checking for a cycle in the directed graph. If there is a cycle, the edge that completes the cycle is the redundant edge.

- The Union-Find data structure will keep track of the parent of each node and will check if adding an edge will create a cycle by checking if the parent of the end node is already set. 
- If a cycle is detected, the edge that completes the cycle is the redundant edge.
-  To handle the case where there are multiple candidates for the redundant edge, the algorithm checks for a second edge pointing to the same node and saves it as a candidate for the redundant edge.
