## 684. Redundant Connection (M)

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with **one additional edge added**. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of* `n` *nodes*. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Example**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

### 并查集

对于每一个edge，将其合并在并查集当中，若有一个edge，其两个node的parent相同，那么该edge会形成环，则为redundant edge

用到路径压缩，因为我们只需要考虑每个node所连接的根节点，所以可以将所有的子节点都直接指向根节点，节省搜索时间

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges):
        """
        :type edges: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        """
        Use Union Find if there is a node that their parents are same,
        then this edge is redundant
        """
        if not edges: 
            return None
        
        self.father = {i:i for i in range(1, len(edges) + 1)}
        
        for edge in edges:
            if self.union(edge[0], edge[1]):
                return edge
        return None
    
    def find(self, node):
        path = []
        father = self.father[node]
        
        while node != father:
            path.append(node)
            node = father
            father = self.father[node]
        
        for n in path:
            self.father[n] = node
        
        return node
    
    def union(self, a, b):
        fa, fb = self.find(a), self.find(b)
        if fa != fb:
            self.father[fb] = fa
            return False
        else:
            return True
```
