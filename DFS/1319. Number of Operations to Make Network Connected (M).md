## 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected (M)

There are `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by ethernet cables `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between computers `a` and `b`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

Given an initial computer network `connections`. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected. Return the *minimum number of times* you need to do this in order to **make all the computers connected**. If it's not possible, return -1. 

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: 2
```



### 思路

这个问题的实质是**寻找联通块**问题，来找到有多少个顶点没有被链接。若多余的连接数大于未连接的顶点，那么最小链接次数即为未被链接的顶点个数。

**1. Union Find**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def makeConnected(self, n, connections):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type connections: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # The minimum connection to make a graph is N - 1
        if len(connections) < n -1:
            return -1
        
        parents = [i for i in range(n)]
        
        # Union-find to find the parent
        def find_parent(node):
            parent = parents[node]
            while node != parent:
                node = parent
                parent = parents[node]
            return node
        
        
        # count the number of unconnected_node, n - 1 means the first node is viewed as connected
        unconnected_node = n - 1
        # count the number of redundant connection
        redundant_connection = 0
        
        for x, y in connections:
            # Not in the group yet, then reduce the unconnected node.
            if find_parent(x) != find_parent(y):
                # Connect them by making their parent same
                parents[find_parent(y)] = find_parent(x) 
                unconnected_node -= 1
            # They are already connected to the same root or parent then there is a redundant connection
            else:
                redundant_connection += 1
            
        
        if redundant_connection >= unconnected_node:
            return unconnected_node
        return -1
```



**2. DFS**

用DFS来寻找联通快，那么将联通快看做一个node, 将他们连接起来所需要的次数为： **no. of islands - 1**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def makeConnected(self, n, connections):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type connections: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(connections) < n- 1:
            return -1
        
        # Create the graph for each node
        graph = {}
        for i in range(n):
            graph[i] = []
            
        for x, y in connections:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)
            
        visited = set()
        
        # Search the number of island, final results would be: number of islands - 1
        n_components = 0
        for node in graph:
            if node not in visited:
                visited.add(node)
                self.dfs(node, visited, graph)
                # If the node is not visited, there is an island
                n_components += 1
        
        return n_components - 1
    
    # Use DFS to search the connected node and mark the connected node as visited
    def dfs(self, node, visited, graph):
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                self.dfs(neighbor, visited, graph)
```
