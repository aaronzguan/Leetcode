## 1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination (M) - Backtrack and Memorization

Given the `edges` of a directed graph where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`, and two nodes `source` and `destination` of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from `source` eventually, end at `destination`, that is:

- At least one path exists from the `source` node to the `destination` node
- If a path exists from the `source` node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to `destination`.
- The number of possible paths from `source` to `destination` is a finite number.

Return `true` if and only if all roads from `source` lead to `destination`.

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_2.png)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: false
Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_3.png)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: true
```



### Solution - Cycle detection in Directed Graph+ Memorization

For each outgoing edge, explore that path to the end.

- Use backtarck to check if there is a cycle. 
- Use mmemorization ot avoid overlaps

```python
class Solution(object):
    def leadsToDestination(self, n, edges, source, destination):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type edges: List[List[int]]
        :type source: int
        :type destination: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for edge in edges:
            graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        
        # Flase if there is outgoing paths from destination
        if graph[destination]:
            return False

        return self.dfs(graph, source, destination, set(), set())
        
    
    def dfs(self, graph, node, destination, cycle, visited):
        if node not in graph:
            return node == destination
        
        # If the node we have already explored and it can eventually leads to destination, we don't need to go over the path again
        if node in visited:
            return True
        
        if node in cycle:
            return False
        
        cycle.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if not self.dfs(graph, neighbor, destination, cycle, visited):
                return False
        cycle.remove(node)
        visited.add(node)  # Memorization: the node can eventually leads to the destination
        return True
```

Time Complexity: O(V+E), V: vertices, E: edges, we iterate through each node and each vertex in the graph only once.
