## 947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column (M)

On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either **the same row or the same column** as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of the `ith` stone, return *the largest possible number of stones that can be removed*.

Example:

```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
```



### Solution - 寻找并删除连通块问题

用graph来表示stone的连接，用DFS将所有连接的stone删去 （mark as visted）即删去连通块，记录删除的次数则为保留的stone数量，因为每一个island要保留一个stone

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeStones(self, stones):
        """
        :type stones: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        graph = self.constructGraph(stones)
        num_stones = 0
        visited = set()
        for i in range(len(stones)):
            if i not in visited:
                num_stones += 1
                self.dfs(graph, visited, i)
        
        return len(stones) - num_stones

    def dfs(self, graph, visited, node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                self.dfs(graph, visited, neighbor)
    
    def constructGraph(self, stones):
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for i, stone in enumerate(stones):
            for j in range(i+1, len(stones)):
                if stone[0] == stones[j][0] or stone[1] == stones[j][1]:
                    graph[i].append(j)
                    graph[j].append(i)
        return graph
```
