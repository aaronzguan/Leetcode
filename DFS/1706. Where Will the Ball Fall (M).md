## 1706. Where Will the Ball Fall (M)

You have a 2-D grid of size m x n representing a box, and you have n balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as 1.
A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as -1.
We drop one ball at the top of each column of the box. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the ith column at the top, or -1 if the ball gets stuck in the box.

**Example:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,-1,-1],[1,1,1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: [1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: This example is shown in the photo.
Ball b0 is dropped at column 0 and falls out of the box at column 1.
Ball b1 is dropped at column 1 and will get stuck in the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.
Ball b2 is dropped at column 2 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b3 is dropped at column 3 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 0.
Ball b4 is dropped at column 4 and will get stuck on the box between column 2 and 3 and row 1.

### DFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findBall(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        answer = []
        for i in range(len(grid[0])):
            answer.append(self.dfs(0, i, grid))
        return answer
        
    def dfs(self, row, col, grid):
        # exit
        if row == len(grid):
            return col
        
        # recursive
        if grid[row][col] == 1:
            
            if col != len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[row][col+1] == 1:
                return self.dfs(row + 1, col + 1, grid)
            else:
                return -1
        elif grid[row][col] == -1:
            if col != 0 and grid[row][col-1] == -1:
                return self.dfs(row + 1, col - 1, grid)
            else:
                return -1

```
