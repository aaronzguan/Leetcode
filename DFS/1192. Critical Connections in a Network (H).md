## 1192. Critical Connections in a Network (H)

There are `n` servers numbered from `0` to `n-1` connected by undirected server-to-server `connections` forming a network where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between servers `a` and `b`. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A *critical connection* is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.

### 思路 DFS

整体思路就是把环删去，那么剩下的链接就是关键的链接．

用DFS的层级代表什么时候node被visit过，如果发现之前就visit过，那么说明有环，把整个环删掉．

并且整个环都要知道最小的depth在哪里．这里需要用到`rank`这一概念．不仅可以作为`visited`来告诉我们什么node被visit过，并且也能告诉我们都有什么edge是属于环的．

That being said, we would need to see what variations we can make to the standard depth-first traversal to catch ***all*** cycles in the graph and then remove the corresponding edges along the way. For this, we will look at the concept of a `rank` of a node. This is very similar to the concept of `discovery times` in Tarjan's algorithm for those who are familiar with that algorithm. Since this is a graph with no designated concept of a `root` node like in the case of trees, we can consider any node to be the root node of our graph. Essentially, we need some node to start the traversal from, and that node becomes the root node for all intents and purposes in our algorithm.

The rank of the root node is always `0`. If a node has not yet been visited, we'll keep the rank as `-inf/None`. Define **rank** of a node: The depth of a node during a DFS. The starting node has a *rank* 0. Only the nodes on the current DFS path have non-special *ranks*. In other words, only the nodes that we've started visiting, but haven't finished visiting, have *ranks*. So `0 <= rank < n`.

So how does this rank help us in detecting cycles in the graph? Well, it works exactly like keeping a set of visited nodes would work. At each step of our traversal, we maintain the rank of the nodes we've come across until now on the current path. If at any point, we come across a neighbor that has a rank lower than the current node's rank, we know that the neighbor must have already been visited. In other words, if we started along a path with rank `0` from the root node and are currently at a node with rank `m` and now we discover a node that already has a rank assigned to it and that value is `0 <= n < m`, then it implies the presence of a cycle.

![The use of rank in finding out a cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/Figures/1192/img3.png)

We can detect a cycle simply by checking if a rank has already been assigned to some neighbor or not (except for the parent of course, which we can handle separately). So when we detect a cycle, we can discard the current edge since that edge cannot be a critical connection. In our example graph above, we can discard edge `E-B`. However, how do we discard edges `B-D` and `D-E`? The mere presence of a cycle in a subgraph doesn't guarantee that an ancestral edge/node will also be a part of the cycle.

> What we need is the minimum rank that a cycle includes. We need our traversal function to return this information so that the previous callers can use it to identify if an edge has to be discarded or not.
