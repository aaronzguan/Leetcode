## 254. Factor Combinations (M) - Backtracking

Numbers can be regarded as the product of their factors.

- For example, `8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2 x 4`.

Given an integer `n`, return *all possible combinations of its factors*. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Note** that the factors should be in the range `[2, n - 1]`.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 12
Output: [[2,6],[3,4],[2,2,3]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 37
Output: []
```



### Solution

Return all possible combinations: **Backtracking**

Need to find all possible factors in `[2, sqrt(n)]`. `sqrt(n)` would be upper bound.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getFactors(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        result = []
        self.dfs(n, [], 2, result)
        return result

    def dfs(self, n, factors, start, result):
        if factors:
            result.append(factors + [n]) # Add factors + [n] to result

        for factor in range(start, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % factor == 0:
                factors.append(factor) # Add this num to factor list
                self.dfs(n/factor, factors, factor, result)
                factors.pop() # BackTrack
```
