## 1219. Path with Maximum Gold (M)

In a gold mine `grid` of size `m * n`, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, `0` if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

- Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position you can walk one step to the left, right, up or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with `0` gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from **any** position in the grid that has some gold.

**Example:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```

### DFS with Backtrack

从Grid每一个点出发，进行DFS搜索来找到能获取的最多的Gold。其中需要用到Backtrack对已经走过的点进行回溯，保证不会影响其他路径。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getMaximumGold(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        max_gold = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] != 0:
                    max_gold = max(max_gold, self.dfs(i, j, grid))
        return max_gold
    
    def dfs(self, row, col, grid):
        max_gold = 0
        # Mark as visited
        grid[row][col] = -grid[row][col]
        
        for dr, dc in ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)):
            new_r, new_c = row + dr, col + dc
            if 0 <= new_r < len(grid) and 0 <= new_c < len(grid[0]) and grid[new_r][new_c] > 0:
                max_gold = max(max_gold, self.dfs(new_r, new_c, grid))
        
        # Backtrack
        grid[row][col] = -grid[row][col]
        
        return max_gold + grid[row][col]
        
```
