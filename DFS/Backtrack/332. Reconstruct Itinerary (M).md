## 332. Reconstruct Itinerary (M) - Backtracking

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.

**Note:**

1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should **return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order** when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
2. You may assume all tickets **form at least one valid itinerary**.

```
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```



#### Method 1 - DFS with Backtracking

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findItinerary(self, tickets):
        """
        :type tickets: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        
        # construct the graph
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for ticket in tickets:
            graph[ticket[0]].append(ticket[1])
        
        route = ['JFK']
        
        self.dfs('JFK', len(tickets) + 1, graph, route)
        return route
        
    
    def dfs(self, node, totalNodes, graph, route):
        if len(route) == totalNodes:
            return True
        
        # Sort the neighbors to get the smallest lexical order
        allDest = sorted(graph[node])
        
        for dest in allDest:
            route.append(dest)
            graph[node].remove(dest)
            findRoute = self.dfs(dest, totalNodes, graph, route)
            if findRoute:
                return True
            # Backtracking
            route.pop()
            graph[node].append(dest)
        
        return False
```



#### Method 1 - Graph

This method takes advantage of the assumption that all tickets can form at least one valid itinerary.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findItinerary(self, tickets):
        """
        :type tickets: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        target = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for ticket in tickets:
            target[ticket[0]].append(ticket[1])
        
        route = []
        def visit(airport):
            while target[airport]:
                # sort the targets in lexical order but then reverse the order so that pop will get the one with smallest lexical order
                target[airport] = sorted(target[airport])[::-1]
                visit(target[airport].pop())
            route.append(airport)
        
        visit('JFK')
        return route[::-1]
```
