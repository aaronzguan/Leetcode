## 1774. Closest Dessert Cost (M) - Backtracking

You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have `n` ice cream base flavors and `m` types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:

- There must be **exactly one** ice cream base.
- You can add **one or more** types of topping or have no toppings at all.
- There are **at most two** of **each type** of topping.

You are given three inputs:

- `baseCosts`, an integer array of length `n`, where each `baseCosts[i]` represents the price of the `ith` ice cream base flavor.
- `toppingCosts`, an integer array of length `m`, where each `toppingCosts[i]` is the price of **one** of the `ith` topping.
- `target`, an integer representing your target price for dessert.

You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to `target` as possible.

Return *the closest possible cost of the dessert to* `target`. If there are multiple, return *the **lower** one.*

Example:

```
Input: baseCosts = [1,7], toppingCosts = [3,4], target = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
- Choose base 1: cost 7
- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3
- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0
Total: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.
```



### Solution - Backtracking

Need to generate all possible solutions by picking one topping no more than 2 times: Backtracking

Each time we need to compare the current cost with the global cost and update the global cost to be the closest cost to the target.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def closestCost(self, baseCosts, toppingCosts, target):
        """
        :type baseCosts: List[int]
        :type toppingCosts: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.expense = float('inf')
        for baseCost in baseCosts:
            self.helper(baseCost, toppingCosts, 0, target)
        return self.expense
    
    def helper(self, totalCost, toppingCosts, toppingIndex, target):
        if abs(totalCost - target) < abs(self.expense - target):
            self.expense = totalCost
        elif abs(totalCost - target) == abs(self.expense - target):
            self.expense = min(totalCost, self.expense)
        
        if toppingIndex == len(toppingCosts):
            return
        
        for count in range(3):
            totalCost += toppingCosts[toppingIndex] * count
            self.helper(totalCost, toppingCosts, toppingIndex + 1, target)
            totalCost -= toppingCosts[toppingIndex] * count
```

Time Complexity: O(N*3^M^): O(N) for base and O(3^M^) for toppings as each toppings has three possibilities

Space complexity: O(3^M^) for a ternary tree.
