## 425. Word Squares (H)

Given an array of **unique** strings `words`, return *all the* **[word squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square)** *you can build from* `words`. The same word from `words` can be used **multiple times**. You can return the answer in **any order**.

A sequence of strings forms a valid **word square** if the `kth` row and column read the same string, where `0 <= k < max(numRows, numColumns)`.

- For example, the word sequence `["ball","area","lead","lady"]` forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

**Example:**

```
Input: words = ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
Output: [["ball","area","lead","lady"],["wall","area","lead","lady"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
```



### Solution - Backtracking 

The idea is that we construct the word square ***row by row\*** from top to down. At each row, we simply do *trial and error*, *i.e.* we try with one word, if it does not meet the constraint then we try another one.

In order to check if a word can but put in this row, a **prefix hash table** need to be created.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def wordSquares(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        self.n = len(words[0])
        result = []
        prefix_table = self.buildPrefixHashTable(words)
		
        # For each word, put it at the first row
        for word in words:
            word_square=[word]
            self.dfs(1, word_square, prefix_table, result)
        return result
    
    def dfs(self, step, word_square, prefix_table, result):
        if len(word_square) == self.n:
            result.append(word_square[:])
            return
        # get the required prefix for the word to form the word square
        prefix = "".join(word[step] for word in word_square)
        for candidate in self.getWordsWithPrefix(prefix_table, prefix):
            word_square.append(candidate)
            self.dfs(step+1, word_square, prefix_table, result)
            word_square.pop()

    def buildPrefixHashTable(self, words):
        prefixTable = {}
        for word in words:
            for i in range(1, len(word)):
                if word[:i] in prefixTable:
                    prefixTable[word[:i]].add(word)
                else:
                    prefixTable[word[:i]] = set([word])
        return prefixTable

    def getWordsWithPrefix(self, prefix_table, prefix):
        if prefix in prefix_table:
            return prefix_table[prefix]
        else:
            return set([])
```
