## 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes (M)

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

Example:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```



### Solution 1 - Linear Time:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def countNodes(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        return 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)
```

- Time complexity : O(N).
- Space complexity : O(d)=O(log⁡N) to keep the recursion stack, where d is a tree depth.

### Solution 2 - Binary Search O(log^2^N)

Solution1 doesn't profit from the fact that the tree is a complete one.

That means that complete tree has 2^k^ nodes in the kth level if the kth level is not the last one. The last level may be not filled completely, and hence in the last level the number of nodes could vary from 1 to 2^d^, where d is a tree depth.

前d-1层的Node 总数为：2^d^ - 1，问题则转化为求最后一层Nodes的个数。因为最后一层的nodes都是靠左排列的，那么可以用binary search来找最后Node的index。

如何判断最后一层的第ith node是否存在？可以继续用binary search

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(d^2^)=O(log⁡^2^N) where *d* is a tree depth.
- Space complexity : O(1).
