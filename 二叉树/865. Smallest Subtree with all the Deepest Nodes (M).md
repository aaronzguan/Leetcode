## 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes (M)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the depth of each node is **the shortest distance to the root**.

Return *the smallest subtree* such that it contains **all the deepest nodes** in the original tree.

A node is called **the deepest** if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The **subtree** of a node is tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.
