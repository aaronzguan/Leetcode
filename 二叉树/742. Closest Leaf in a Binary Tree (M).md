## 742. Closest Leaf in a Binary Tree (M) - BFS after Creating Graph

Given the root of a binary tree where every node has a unique value and a target integer k, return the value of the nearest leaf node to the target k in the tree.

Nearest to a leaf means the least number of edges traveled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a leaf if it has no children.

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.
```



### 思路

用DFS构建 graph 再用BFS去找到closest leaf



```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def findClosestLeaf(self, root, k):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        # find the node first and convert to graph using dfs
        def getGraph(node, par):
            if node:
                graph[node].append(par)
                graph[par].append(node)
                getGraph(node.left, node)
                getGraph(node.right, node)
        
        getGraph(root, None)
        queue = collections.deque(node for node in graph if node and node.val == k)
        visited = set(queue)
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                return node.val
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor and neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
```
