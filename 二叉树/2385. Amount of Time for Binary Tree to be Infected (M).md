## 2385. Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected (M) - BFS after Creating Graph

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with **unique** values, and an integer `start`. At minute `0`, an **infection** starts from the node with value `start`.

Each minute, a node becomes infected if:

- The node is currently uninfected.
- The node is adjacent to an infected node.

Return *the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected.*



**Example:**

```
Input: root = [1,5,3,null,4,10,6,9,2], start = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The following nodes are infected during:
- Minute 0: Node 3
- Minute 1: Nodes 1, 10 and 6
- Minute 2: Node 5
- Minute 3: Node 4
- Minute 4: Nodes 9 and 2
It takes 4 minutes for the whole tree to be infected so we return 4.
```



### Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def amountOfTime(self, root, start):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :type start: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)

        def dfs(node, parent):
            if node:
                graph[node].append(parent)
                graph[parent].append(node)
                dfs(node.left, node)
                dfs(node.right, node)
        
        dfs(root, None)

        queue = collections.deque(node for node in graph if node and node.val == start)
        visited = set(queue)
        time = 0
        while queue:
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if neighbor is not None and neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            time += 1
        return time - 1
```
