## 79 - Word Search (M)

Given a 2D board and a word, *find if the word exists in the grid. **Return True or False***

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

```
board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.
```

```python
m, n = list(map(int, input().split())) # Input m: number of rows, n, number of columns
grid = []

for _ in range(m):
	grid.append(list(map(str, input().split()))) # Input, the m x n character grid 

word = list(map(str, input().split())) # The target word


def search2D(row, col, word):

	# If the rest of word length is 0, it means all chars are found
	if len(word) == 0:
		return True

	# Backtrack
	# Mark the cell as visited to avoid ['A', 'B', 'C'] view as 'ABCB' 
	# This cell has to be changed back at the end
	temp = grid[row][col]
	grid[row][col] = '#'

	# DFS to recursively search
	for dr, dc in ([1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]):
		new_r, new_c = row + dr, col + dc
		# The location should be bounded
		if new_r >= 0 and new_r < len(grid) and new_c >= 0 and new_c < len(grid[0]):
			# If found the next char, loop agian to find the rest of words start at the currect location
			if grid[new_r][new_c] == word[0]:
				if search2D(new_r, new_c, word[1:]):
					return True

	# Backtracking
	grid[row][col] = temp

	return False

for i in range(len(grid)):
	for j in range(len(grid[0])):
		# If find the fist char, search the rest of the word, so using word[1:]
		if grid[i][j] == word[0]:
			if search2D(i, j, word[1:]):
				return True
return False
```
