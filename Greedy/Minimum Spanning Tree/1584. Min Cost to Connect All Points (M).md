## 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points (M)

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the manhattan distance between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

Return the *minimum cost to make all points connected*. All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
Output: 20
Explanation:
We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.

### Solution: Minimum Spanning Tree - Primâ€™s Algorithm using Heap




```python
	class Solution(object):
	    def minCostConnectPoints(self, points):
	        """
	        :type points: List[List[int]]

            Prim's Algorithm takes O(NlgN)
