## 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons (M)

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return *the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons*.

Example:

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```



### Solution - Greedy

Let's sort the balloons by the end coordinate, and then check them one by one. The first balloon is a green one number `0`, it ends at coordinate `6`, and there is no balloons ending before it because of sorting.

The other balloons have two possibilities :

- To have a start coordinate smaller than `6`, like a red balloon. These ones could be burst together with the balloon `0` by one arrow.
- To have a start coordinate larger than `6`, like a yellow balloon. These ones couldn't be burst together with the balloon `0` by one arrow, and hence one needs to increase the number of arrows here.

> That means that one could always track the end of the current balloon, and ignore all the balloons which end before it. Once the current balloon is ended (= the next balloon starts after the current balloon), one has to increase the number of arrows by one and start to track the end of the next balloon.



```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points):
        """
        :type points: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not points:
            return 0
        
        points.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])

        count = 1 
        first_end = points[0][1]
        for point in points:
            if point[0] > first_end:
                count += 1
                first_end = point[1]
        
        return count 
```



- Time complexity : O(Nlog⁡N)  because of sorting of input data.
- Space complexity : O(N) or O(log⁡N)
  - The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the implementation of each program language.
  - For instance, the `list.sort()` function in Python is implemented with the [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) algorithm whose space complexity is O(N).
  - In Java, the [Arrays.sort()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#sort-byte:A-) is implemented as a variant of quicksort algorithm whose space complexity is O(log⁡N).
