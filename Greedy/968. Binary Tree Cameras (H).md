## 968. Binary Tree Cameras (H) - Greedy DFS

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return *the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree*.

Example 1:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)

```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```

Example 2:

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)

```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```



### Solution - Greedy DFS

Start from bottom-up. Considering placing a camera with the deepest nodes first and working our way up the tree.

If a node has children that are not covered by a camera, then we must place a camera here. Additionally, if a node has no parent and it is not covered, we must place a camera here.

所有的子节点都不管，在他们的父节点放camera

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def minCameraCover(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.ans = 0
        covered = {None}

        def dfs(node, par=None):
            if node:
                dfs(node.left, node)
                dfs(node.right, node)

                if ((par is None and node not in covered) or (node.left not in covered or node.right not in covered)):
                    self.ans += 1
                    covered.add(node)
                    covered.add(par)
                    covered.add(node.left)
                    covered.add(node.right)
        
        dfs(root, None)
        return self.ans
```
