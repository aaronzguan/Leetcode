## 134. Gas Station (M)

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return *the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return* `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```



### Solution - Greedy:

1. Initiate`curr_tank` as zero, and choose station `0` as a starting station.
2. Iterate over all stations :
   - Update  `curr_tank` at each step, by adding `gas[i]` and subtracting `cost[i]`.
   - If `curr_tank < 0` at `i + 1` station, make `i + 1` station a new starting point and reset `curr_tank = 0` to start with an empty tank.
3. Return `starting station` otherwise.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1
        
        index = 0
        remain_gas = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            remain_gas += gas[i]-cost[i]
            if gas_remain < 0:
                remain_gas = 0
                index = i+1
        return index
```
