## 529. Minesweeper (M)

Let's play the minesweeper game ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)), [online game](http://minesweeperonline.com/))!

You are given an `m x n` char matrix `board` representing the game board where:

- `'M'` represents an unrevealed mine,
- `'E'` represents an unrevealed empty square,
- `'B'` represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
- digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
- `'X'` represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array `click` where `click = [clickr, clickc]` represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares (`'M'` or `'E'`).

Return *the board after revealing this position according to the following rules*:

1. If a mine `'M'` is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to `'X'`.
2. If an empty square `'E'` with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank `'B'` and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
3. If an empty square `'E'` with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
4. Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","M","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"]], click = [3,0]
Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: board = [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]], click = [1,2]
Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","X","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
```



### Solution  - DFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def updateBoard(self, board, click):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :type click: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        
        def update_board(r, c):
            
            if r< 0 or r >= len(board) or c < 0 or c >= len(board[0]):
                return
                
            if board[r][c] != 'E':
                return

            mine_cnt = 0
            directions = [(-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0)]
            # Check the number of mines
            for d in directions:
                nr, nc = r + d[0], c + d[1]
                if 0 <= nr < len(board) and 0<= nc < len(board[0]) and board[nr][nc] == 'M':
                    mine_cnt += 1
			
            # Two cases depending on the number of mines, continue dfs or change value
            if mine_cnt == 0: # no adjacent mine
                board[r][c] = 'B'
                
                # only continue update the borad when it is 'B'
                for d in directions:
                    ni, nj = r + d[0], c + d[1]
                    update_board(ni, nj)
            else:
                board[r][c] = str(mine_cnt)
            
        
        if not board:
            return []
        
        r, c = click[0], click[1]
        # If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to 'X'.
        if board[r][c] == 'M':
            board[r][c] = 'X'
            return board
        
        # Run dfs to update the board
        update_board(r, c)
        return board
```



### Solution - BFS

**If the cell is 'M'**, then die.
**If not**, start **BFS**:

- If the cell is not 'E', skip
- Firstly count the number of mines
  - Two cases depending on the number of mines, continue **next level bfs** or **change value**

```python
class Solution:
    def updateBoard(self, board: List[List[str]], click: List[int]) -> List[List[str]]:
        DIRECTIONS = [(-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0)]
        i, j, m, n = *click, len(board), len(board[0])
        
        if board[i][j] == 'M':
            board[i][j] = 'X'
        else:
            queue = deque([(i, j)])
            while queue:
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                if board[x][y] != 'E':
                    continue
                num_mines = 0
                # First count the number of mines
                for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
                    new_x = x + dx
                    new_y = y + dy
                    if not (0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n):
                        continue
                    if board[new_x][new_y] == 'M':
                        num_mines += 1
                # Two cases depending on the number of mines, continue bfs or change value
                if not num_mines: 
                    board[x][y] = 'B'
                    for dx, dy in DIRECTIONS:
                        new_x = x + dx
                        new_y = y + dy
                        if not (0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n):
                            continue
                        queue.append((new_x, new_y))
                else: 
                    board[x][y] = str(num_mines)
        
        return board
```
