## 934. Sortest Bridge - DFS/BFS

**寻找在2D grid中能够连接两个岛屿的最短路径**

In a given 2D binary array `A`, there are **two** islands.  (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s not connected to any other 1s.) Now, we may change `0`s to `1`s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island. Return the smallest number of `0`s that must be flipped.  (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

```
Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1
```

#### 思路：

**Find and Grow:** We can use a DFS to find the islands, and a BFS to "grow" one of them.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def shortestBridge(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Use dfs to find all islands point
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= len(A) or j >= len(A) or A[i][j] != 1:
                return
            # Mark the island as visited because they are connected
            A[i][j] = -1
            # Get the locations of the first island
            bfs.append((i,j))
            dfs(i-1, j)
            dfs(i+1, j)
            dfs(i, j-1)
            dfs(i, j+1)
            
        bfs = []
        step = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            for j in range(len(A)):
                # When find an island, mark all adjacent island as visited and get their location
                if A[i][j] == 1:
                    dfs(i, j)
                    break
            # Only get the location of one island is enough, no need to get all islands
            # We can use bfs to extend this island and find the smallest path
            if bfs:
                break

        while bsf:
            new = []
            for i, j in bfs:
                for x, y in ((i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)):
                    if 0 <= x < len(A) and 0 <= y < len(A):
                        if A[x][y] == 1:
                            return step
                        elif not A[x][y]:
                            # Mark the extended cell as visted
                            A[x][y] = -1
                            # Extend the visted cell as part of the island
                            new.append((x, y))
            step += 1
            bfs = new
