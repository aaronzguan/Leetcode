## 1834. Single-Threaded CPU (M)

You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `ith` task will be available to process at `enqueueTimei` and will take `processingTimei` to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process **at most one** task at a time and will act in the following way:

- If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
- If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the **shortest processing time**. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
- Once a task is started, the CPU will **process the entire task** without stopping.
- The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return *the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.*

**Example**

```
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]
Output: [0,2,3,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows: 
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
```



### Min-Heap

首先考虑当前cpu时间能够处理的所有task．对于这些task使用min-heap来选择最少processing time的task，直到把当前所有available的task都处理完，更新现在的cpu time，再用相同方法处理available tasks

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getOrder(self, tasks):
        """
        :type tasks: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # sort the tasks by enqueueTime and also keep their index        
        tasks = [[task[0], task[1], i] for i, task in enumerate(tasks)]
        tasks = sorted(tasks)
        result, heap = [], []
        t = 0
        i = 0
        while len(result) < len(tasks):
            while i < len(tasks) and tasks[i][0] <= t:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (tasks[i][1], tasks[i][2]))
                i += 1
            # If there are multiple tasks avaiable at the current time
            # Choose the task with the least processing time 
            if heap:
                ptime, index = heapq.heappop(heap)
                result.append(index)
                t += ptime
            # If there is no avaiable tasks, jump to the next avaiable task
            else:
                t = tasks[i][0]
        return result
```
