## 973 - K losest Points to Origin (M) - Heap

We have a list of `points` on the plane.  Find the `K` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

给定一些 `points` 和一个 `origin`，从 `points` 中找到 `k` 个离 `origin` 最近的点。按照距离由小到大返回。

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    """
    @param points: a list of points
    @param origin: a point
    @param k: An integer
    @return: the k closest points
    """
    def kClosest(self, points, origin, k):
        # write your code here
        heap = []
        for point in points:
            dist = self.get_distance(origin,point)
            # Max heap, 加负号
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-dist, -point.x, -point.y))
            
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        result = []
        while len(heap) > 0:
            _, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            result.append(Point(-x, -y))
        result.reverse()
        return result
    
    def get_distance(self, point_a, point_b):
        return (point_a.x - point_b.x)**2 + (point_a.y - point_b.y)**2
```
