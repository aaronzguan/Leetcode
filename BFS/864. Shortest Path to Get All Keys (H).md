## 864. Shortest Path to Get All Keys (H)

We are given a 2-dimensional `grid`. `"."` is an empty cell, `"#"` is a wall, `"@"` is the starting point, (`"a"`, `"b"`, ...) are keys, and (`"A"`, `"B"`, ...) are locks.

We start at the starting point, and one move consists of walking one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions. We cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall. If we walk over a key, we pick it up. We can't walk over a lock unless we have the corresponding key.

For some 1 <= K <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first `K` letters of the English alphabet in the grid. This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.

Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

**Example:**

```
Input: ["@.a.#","###.#","b.A.B"]
Output: 8
```



### BFS

求获得所有key的最小移动次数，用BFS．难点在于要保存当前寻获的key的数量，并且在key数量不同的时候可以重复走同一个grid．第二点在于当获得key时，其对应的lock也可以走．所以也要存储当前可以走的grid种类

```python
class Solution(object):
    def shortestPathAllKeys(self, grid):

        :type grid: List[str]
        :rtype: int
        """

        n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
