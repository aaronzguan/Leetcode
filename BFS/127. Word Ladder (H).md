## 127. Word Ladder (H) - BFS

Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of **shortest transformation** sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.

**最短路径问题： 分层BFS，用哈希表记录距离** 

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```
