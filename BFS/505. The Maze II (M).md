## 505. The Maze II (M)

There is a **ball** in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling **up**, **down**, **left** or **right**, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the ball's **start position**, the **destination** and the **maze**, find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of **empty spaces** traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.

```
Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)

Output: 12

Explanation: One shortest way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
             The total distance is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.
```

### 1. BFS

* 用visited来记录上次走到某一处时的路径长度
* 当走到同一位置时，打擂台，要比之前断才能入队
* 要把所有路径都走过才会走到终点的最短路径，所以终止条件是 queue为空

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, maze, start, destination):
        if start == destination:
            return 0
        
        queue = collections.deque()
        queue.append((start[0], start[1], 0))
        visited = {}
        # 用visited来记录上次走到该位置时的路径
        visited[(start[0], start[1])] = 0
        
        while queue:
            row, col, step = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in ((1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)):
                next_r, next_c = row + dr, col + dc
                # 将Step赋值给另一个variable, 那么改变该variable不会影响原来的step, 则可继续以原始Step向下个方向遍历
                dist = step
                dist += 1
                # 一直向一个方向前进，滚球
                while 0 <= next_r < len(maze) and 0 <= next_c < len(maze[0]) and maze[next_r][next_c] == 0:
                    next_r += dr
                    next_c += dc
                    dist += 1
                    
                next_r -= dr
                next_c -= dc
                dist -= 1
                # 当再次走到同一位置时，打擂台，要比之前的短才能够入队  
                if ((next_r, next_c) in visited and visited[(next_r, next_c)] > dist) or (next_r, next_c) not in visited:
                    visited[(next_r, next_c)] = dist
                    queue.append((next_r, next_c, dist))

        return visited.get((destination[0], destination[1]), -1)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(MN*max(M, N)), complete traversal of maze will be done in the worst case. Here, M and N refers to the number of rows and columns of the maze. Further, for every current node chosen, we can travel upto a maximum depth of max(M, N) in any direction.

**Space Complexity:** O(MN), queue can grow up to M*N in the worst case.
