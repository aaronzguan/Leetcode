## 1631. Path with Minimum Effort (M)

You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum **effort**.

A route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return *the minimum **effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.*

Example:

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
```

**思路**：最短路算法

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minimumEffortPath(self, heights):
        """
        :type heights: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n, m = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        dist = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        dist[0][0]= 0
        close_set = set()
        open_set = [(0, 0, 0)]  # f-value, row, col
        
        while open_set:
            cur_dist, row, col = heapq.heappop(open_set)
            if row == n - 1 and col == m - 1:
                return cur_dist
            if (row, col) in close_set:
                continue
             
            close_set.add((row, col))
            
            for dr, dc in ((0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1)):
                next_r, next_c = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= next_r < n and 0 <= next_c < m:
                    next_dist = max(cur_dist, abs(heights[next_r][next_c] - heights[row][col]))
                    heapq.heappush(open_set, (next_dist, next_r, next_c))
```
