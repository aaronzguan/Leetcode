## 743. Network Delay Time (M)

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return *the **minimum** time it takes for all the* `n` *nodes to receive the signal*. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`

**Example**

```
Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
Output: 2
```



### Solution - Dijkstra 

用Dijkstra来找到访问所有node所需的最短总时间

```python
class Solution(object):
    def networkDelayTime(self, times, n, k):
        """
        :type times: List[List[int]]
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for time in times:
            graph[time[0]].append((time[1], time[2]))
        
        heap = [(0, k)]
        visited=set()

        while heap:
            size = len(heap)
            for _ in range(size):
                travel_time, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
                
                if node in visited:
                    continue
                visited.add(node)

                if len(visited) == n:
                    return travel_time

                for next_node, time in graph[node]:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (travel_time + time, next_node))
        return -1
```
