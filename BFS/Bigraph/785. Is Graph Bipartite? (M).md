## 785. Is Graph Bipartite? (M)

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

- There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
- There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
- If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` *if and only if it is **bipartite***.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi1.jpg)

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```



### 思路：二分图染色

通过黑白染色我们可以判断一个无向图是否二分图:

遍历整个图, 将相邻的节点染成不同的颜色, 如果可以完成这个遍历(即染色过程没有冲突), 说明是二分图.

可以用BFS或DFS来实现, 只需要根据当前节点的颜色设定下一个节点的颜色即可, 如果下一个节点已经被染成了相同的颜色, 说明发生了冲突．

### 1. BFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isBipartite(self, graph):
        """
        :type graph: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        queue = collections.deque([])
        coloring = [0] * len(graph)
        
        # 需要注意的是， 不是所有的nodes都联通， 所有要额外搞个loop来保证所有nodes都visit过。
        for node in range(len(graph)):
            if coloring[node] != 0:
                continue
            
            queue.append(node)
            coloring[node] = 1
            
            while queue:
                cur_vertice = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[cur_vertice]:
                    if coloring[neighbor] == 0:
                        coloring[neighbor] = -coloring[cur_vertice]
                        queue.append(neighbor)
                    elif coloring[neighbor] == coloring[cur_vertice]:
                        return False
        return True
```



### 2. DFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isBipartite(self, graph):
        """
        :type graph: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        n = len(graph)
        self.color = [0] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if self.color[i] == 0 and not self.colored(i, graph, 1):
                return False
        return True 
    
    
    def colored(self, node, graph, color):
        self.color[node] = color
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if self.color[neighbor] == 0 and not self.colored(neighbor, graph, -color):
                return False
            elif self.color[neighbor] == self.color[node]:
                return False
        
        return True
```
