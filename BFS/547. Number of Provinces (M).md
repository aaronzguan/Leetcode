## 547. Number of Provinces (M)

There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `ith` city and the `jth` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return *the total number of **provinces***.

**Example:**

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```



### BFS

用BFS寻找联通块的问题．但是要从每一个node出发用BFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected):
        """
        :type isConnected: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Use BFS to find the number of connected regions
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        n = len(isConnected)
        # Construct the graph
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if isConnected[i][j] == 1:
                    graph[i].append(j)
                    graph[j].append(i)
        
        results = 0
        visited = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                queue = deque([i])
                visited.add(i)
                while queue:
                    node = queue.popleft()
                    for neighbor in graph[node]:
                        if neighbor not in visited:
                            visited.add(neighbor)
                            queue.append(neighbor)
                results += 1
        
        return results
```
