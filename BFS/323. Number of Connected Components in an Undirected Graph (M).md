## 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph (M)

You have a graph of `n` nodes. You are given an integer `n` and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return *the number of connected components in the graph*.

Example 1:
