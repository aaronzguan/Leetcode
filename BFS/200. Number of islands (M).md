## 200 - Number of islands - BFS/DFS

Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### BFS Soluiton:

```python
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    """
    @param grid: a boolean 2D matrix
    @return: an integer
    """
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        # write your code here
        nums = 0
        # 定义一个集合 visited来存储已经访问过的岛屿
        visited = set()
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                # 若该位置为岛屿并且从未访问过，则为新的岛屿，从该点开始BFS
                if grid[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:
                    self.is_island(grid, i, j, visited)
                    nums += 1
        return nums
    
    def is_island(self, grid, r, c, visited):
        queue = deque([(r, c)])
        visited.add((r, c))
        while queue:
            x, y = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in ((1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)):
                row, col = x + dr, y + dc 
                if 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0<= col < len(grid[0]) and (row, col) not in visited and grid[row][col] == 1:
                    queue.append([row, col])
                    visited.add((row, col))
```

### DFS Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        num_islands = 0
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == '1':
                    # Mark the adjacent island as visited because they are connected
                    self.part_of_island(grid, r, c)
                    num_islands += 1
        return num_islands
    
    def part_of_island(self, grid, i, j):
        if i >= len(grid) or j>= len(grid[0]) or i<0 or j<0 or grid[i][j] != '1':
            return
        grid[i][j] = '#' # Mark the visited island as #
        # DFS to search 4 neighbors
        self.part_of_island(grid, i, j+1)
        self.part_of_island(grid, i, j-1)
        self.part_of_island(grid, i+1, j)
        self.part_of_island(grid, i-1, j)
```
