## 130. Surrounded Regions (M)

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, *capture all regions surrounded by* `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
```

### BFS

1.从四条边开始搜索‘O’，若边上存在‘O’,则从它开始进行DFS/BFS进行特殊标记，这部分的‘O’都不用变成‘X’;
2.标记完成后，则只剩下内部的‘O’了，此时直接将‘O’变成‘X’即可；
3.再将第一步的特殊标记变回‘O’即完成。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def solve(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """ 
        """
        Use BFS to find those zeros at the edge
        """
        if len(board) == 0:
            return None
         
        R, C = len(board), len(board[0])
        
        queue = collections.deque()
        for i in range(R):
            for j in range(C):
                if (i == 0 or i == R - 1 or j == 0 or j == C - 1) and board[i][j] == 'O':
                    queue.append([i, j])
        
        directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]
        
        while queue:
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            board[r][c] = 'D'
            for dr, dc in directions:
                new_r, new_c = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= new_r < R and 0 <= new_c < C and board[new_r][new_c] == 'O':
                    queue.append([new_r, new_c])
                    
        for i in range(R):
            for j in range(C):
                if board[i][j] == 'O':
                     board[i][j] = 'X'
                if board[i][j] == 'D':
                    board[i][j] = 'O'
```
