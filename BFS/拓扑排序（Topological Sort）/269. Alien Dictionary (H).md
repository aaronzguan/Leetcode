## 269. Alien Dictionary (H)

There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet. However, the order among the letters is unknown to you.

You are given a list of strings `words` from the alien language's dictionary, where the strings in `words` are **sorted lexicographically** by the rules of this new language.

Return *a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in **lexicographically increasing order** by the new language's rules. If there is no solution, return* `""`*. If there are multiple solutions, return **any of them***.

A string `s` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `t` if at the **first letter** where they differ, the letter in `s` comes before the letter in `t` in the alien language. If the first `min(s.length, t.length)` letters are the same, then `s` is smaller if and only if `s.length < t.length`.

**Example:**

```
Input: words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output: "wertf"
```
