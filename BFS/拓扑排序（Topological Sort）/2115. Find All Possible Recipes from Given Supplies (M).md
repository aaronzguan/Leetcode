## 2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies (M)

You have information about `n` different recipes. You are given a string array `recipes` and a 2D string array `ingredients`. The `ith` recipe has the name `recipes[i]`, and you can **create** it if you have **all** the needed ingredients from `ingredients[i]`. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from **other** recipes, i.e., `ingredients[i]` may contain a string that is in `recipes`.

You are also given a string array `supplies` containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.

Return *a list of all the recipes that you can create.* You may return the answer in **any order**.

Note that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: recipes = ["bread"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","corn"]
Output: ["bread"]
Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: recipes = ["bread","sandwich"], ingredients = [["yeast","flour"],["bread","meat"]], supplies = ["yeast","flour","meat"]
Output: ["bread","sandwich"]
Explanation:
We can create "bread" since we have the ingredients "yeast" and "flour".
We can create "sandwich" since we have the ingredient "meat" and can create the ingredient "bread".
```



### Solution: Topological Sort

Similar to [210. Course Schedule II(M)](210. Course Schedule II (M).md)

- Store all 0-in-degree recipes into the supply list
- Use Topolofical sort to decrease the indegree of recipes, whenever the in-degree reaches `0`, add it to return list.
