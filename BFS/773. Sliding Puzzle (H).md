## 773. Sliding Puzzle (H)

On a 2x3 `board`, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing `0` and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is *solved* if and only if the `board` is `[[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].`

Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

**Example:**

```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
```



### 分层BFS:

要求找到最少move则可以想到BFS．难点在于对state的判断，需要将grid转化成string

```python
class Solution(object):
    def slidingPuzzle(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        start_state = ""
        for row in board:
            start_state += ''.join(map(str, row))
        
        target_state = '123450'
        
        queue = collections.deque()
        visited = set()
        queue.append(start_state)
        visited.add(start_state)
        
        step = 0
        while queue:
            size = len(queue)
            for _ in range(size):
                state = queue.popleft()
                
                if state == target_state:
                    return step
                
                for next_state in self.get_next(state):
                    if next_state not in visited:
                        queue.append(next_state)
                        visited.add(next_state)
            step += 1
        
        return -1
            
    def get_next(self, state):
        pos = state.find('0')
        row = pos // 3
        col = pos % 3
        
        states = []
        
        for dr, dc in ((1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)):
            next_r, next_c = row + dr, col + dc
            if 0 <= next_r < 2 and 0 <= next_c < 3:
                next_position = next_r * 3 + next_c
                next_state = list(state) # "str: '123' -> convert to list -> ['1', '2', '3'], 因为string具有不可变性" 
                next_state[next_position], next_state[pos] = next_state[pos], next_state[next_position]
                
                next_state = "".join(next_state)
                
                states.append(next_state)
        
        return states
