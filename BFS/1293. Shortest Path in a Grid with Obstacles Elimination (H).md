## 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination (H) - BFS

Given a m * n grid, where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). In one step, you can move up, down, left or right from and to an empty cell.

Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the **upper left corner (0, 0)** to the **lower right corner (m-1, n-1)** given that you can eliminate at most **k** obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return -1.

```
Input: 
grid = 
[[0,0,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,1,1],
 [0,0,0]], 
k = 1

Output: 6

Explanation: 
The shortest path without eliminating any obstacle is 10. 
The shortest path with one obstacle elimination at position (3,2) is 6. Such path is (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2).
```

### 思路:

求最短路径：BFS

多了一个变量：**eliminate obstacle usage count**, 所以BFS时需要记录K值并且每个visted的点也要记录K值，保证（row, col, k）不重复

1. BFS to find the shortest path
2. Use a **set()** to keep track of already visited paths. We only need to keep track of the **row, column, and the eliminate obstacle usage count**. 


```python
from collections import deque
class Solution(object):
    def shortestPath(self, grid, k):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        queue = collections.deque([(0, 0, k, 0)]) # [row, col, eng, step]
        visited = set()
        visited.add((0, 0, k))
        
        while queue:
            row, col, eliminate, step = queue.popleft()
            # 到了终点则返回step，因为是BFS，一定是最短的
            if row == len(grid) - 1 and col == len(grid[0]) - 1:
                return step
            
            for dr, dc in ((1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)):
                next_r, next_c = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= next_r < len(grid) and 0 <= next_c < len(grid[0]):
                    if grid[next_r][next_c] == 1 and eliminate > 0 and (next_r, next_c, eliminate -1) not in visited:
                        visited.add((next_r, next_c, eliminate-1))
                        queue.append((next_r, next_c, eliminate-1, step + 1))
                    if grid[next_r][next_c] == 0 and (next_r, next_c, eliminate) not in visited:
                        visited.add((next_r, next_c, eliminate))
                        queue.append((next_r, next_c, eliminate, step + 1))
        
        return -1
```
