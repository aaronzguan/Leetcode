## 1263. Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location (H) - 推箱子

A storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.

The game is represented by an `m x n` grid of characters `grid` where each element is a wall, floor, or box.

Your task is to move the box `'B'` to the target position `'T'` under the following rules:

- The character `'S'` represents the player. The player can move up, down, left, right in `grid` if it is a floor (empty cell).
- The character `'.'` represents the floor which means a free cell to walk.
- The character `'#' `represents the wall which means an obstacle (impossible to walk there).
- There is only one box `'B'` and one target cell `'T'` in the `grid`.
- The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a **push**.
- The player cannot walk through the box.

Return *the minimum number of **pushes** to move the box to the target*. If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.

**Example:**

```
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We return only the number of times the box is pushed.
```



### Solution - BFS

1. Check whether the box can be shifted to the new position (up, down, left, right)
2. For it to be shifted to the new position the person has to be in a corresponding position.
3. So, we check if the person can travel from his old position to his corresponding new position(using another BFS).
4. If the person can travel to his new position than the box can be shifted, otherwise the box cannot be shifted.
5. We repeat steps 1-4 until we reach the target or it is not possible to move the box anymore.
