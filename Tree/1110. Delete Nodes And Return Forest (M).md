## 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest (M)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```



### Recursive - DFS

If a `node` is a root (which has no parent) and is not deleted, then we add the root to the final `result`. 所以我们只将`root`放进`result`中，当删除一个`node`时，其左右子树均形成新的`root`

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def delNodes(self, root, to_delete):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type to_delete: List[int]
        :rtype: List[TreeNode]
        """
        to_delete = set(to_delete)
        result = []
        self.dfs(root, True, to_delete, result)
        return result
    
    def dfs(self, node, is_root, to_delete, result):
        if not node:
            return None
        # Check if the root is deleted or not
        root_deleted = node.val in to_delete
        # If this is the root and not deleted, we add it to the result
        if is_root and not root_deleted:
            result.append(node)
        
        node.left = self.dfs(node.left, root_deleted, to_delete, result)
        node.right = self.dfs(node.right,root_deleted, to_delete, result)
        
        return None if root_deleted else node
```

Time Complexity: O(N) -> Only iterate through all nodes once

Space Complexity: O(H + N), H is the maximum height of the tree
