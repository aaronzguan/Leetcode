## 266. Find Leaves of Binary Tree (M) - DFS

Given the `root` of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:

- Collect all the leaf nodes.
- Remove all the leaf nodes.
- Repeat until the tree is empty.

Example:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
```



### **Solution - DFS**

从最后一层开始 向上记录node的level，leaves的level为1，向上一层level加1

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def findLeaves(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        result = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        def helper(node):
            if node is None:
                return 0

            level_left = helper(node.left)
            level_right = helper(node.right)

            level_node = max(level_left, level_right) + 1

            result[level_node - 1].append(node.val)

            return level_node

        helper(root)
        output = []
        for i in range(len(result)):
            output.append(result[i])

        return output
```

**Time complexity:** Assuming N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree, traversing the tree takes O(N) time and storing all the pairs at the correct position also takes O(N) time. Hence overall time complexity of this approach is O(N)

**Space complexity:** *O*(*N*), the space used by `output` array.
