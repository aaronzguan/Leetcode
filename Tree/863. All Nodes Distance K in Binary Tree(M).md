## 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree (M)

We are given a binary tree (with root node `root`), a `target` node, and an integer value `K`.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the `target` node. The answer can be returned in any order.

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.

Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.

### 思路：DFS + BFS

可以理解为分层遍历．首先要用DFS遍历二叉树来构建Graph．然后在Graph以target为起点做分层遍历

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution(object):
    def distanceK(self, root, target, K):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type target: TreeNode
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # Use DFS to build the graph
        # Use BFS to search nodes within K
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        self.dfs(root, None, graph)
        
        result = []
        visited = set([target])
        queue = deque([target])
        dist = 0
        if dist == K:
            return [target.val]
        
        while queue:
            # 分层遍历
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        queue.append(neighbor)
                        visited.add(neighbor)
            #　层数加１
            dist += 1
            if dist == K:
                break
        
        return [node.val for node in queue]
        
    # Use DFS to construct the undirectional graph
    def dfs(self, node, parent, graph):
        if not node:
            return
        
        if parent and node:
            graph[parent].append(node)
            graph[node].append(parent)
        
        self.dfs(node.left, node, graph)
        self.dfs(node.right, node, graph)
```
