## 1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs (M) - DFS

You are given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `distance`. A pair of two different **leaf** nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of **the shortest path** between them is less than or equal to `distance`.

Return *the number of good leaf node pairs* in the tree.

Example:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], distance = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The good pairs are [4,5] and [6,7] with shortest path = 2. The pair [4,6] is not good because the length of ther shortest path between them is 4.
```



### Solution 

Get the distance from the leaf to the node, and need to seperate the leafs between two groups: left leaf and right leaf.

For each node, it will have two list `left_dist` and `right_dist`:

- `left_dist` list stores the distance between each left leaf node to this node
- `right_dist` list stores the distance between each right leaf node to this node

Get the num of good pairs:  `sum(l + r <= distance for l in left_dist for r in right_dist)`

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def countPairs(self, root, distance):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type distance: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.res = 0

        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return []
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return [1]
            
            left_dist = dfs(node.left)
            right_dist = dfs(node.right)
            self.res += sum(l + r <= distance for l in left_dist for r in right_dist)
            return [1 + dist for dist in left_dist + right_dist]
        
        dfs(root)
        return self.res
```
