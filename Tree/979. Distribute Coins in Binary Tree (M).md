## 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree (M)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes where each `node` in the tree has `node.val` coins. There are `n` coins in total throughout the whole tree.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.

Return *the **minimum** number of moves required to make every node have **exactly** one coin*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png)

```
Input: root = [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
```



### Solution - Bottom Up Recursive

Traverse the tree in a bottom up approach.

- Look at each subtree. Count the number of nodes it has and comput the sum of its node values
- If there is a difference between the sum and the count, then we increment the number of moves by this difference

It works because we know that for each subtree, the sum of the node values must be equal to the number of nodes in the subtree.

Therefore, for any given subtree:

- If `number of nodes > sum` , then new coins will be pushed down to this subtree by the subtreet's root's parent.
- If `sum > number of nodes`, then the excess coins will have to be sent to the subtree's root's parent so that it can redistribute them.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def distributeCoins(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        self.result = 0

        def distribute(node):
            if not node:
                return 0, 0
            left_num, left_sum = distribute(node.left)
            right_num, right_sum = distribute(node.right)
            # if sum > num, we need to move the excess coins from child to parent
            # if sum < num, we need to move required coins from parent to child
            self.result += abs(left_sum - left_num)
            self.result += abs(right_sum - right_num)

            return left_num + right_num + 1, left_sum + right_sum + node.val

        distribute(root)
        return self.result
```
