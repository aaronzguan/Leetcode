# My Own Leetcode Python Solution and Explanation

This contains some of my Leetcode solutions and explanations in Python, which I find very useful for my interview preparation and coding practice. Most of the explanations are in Chinese. I try to organize the questions depend on their algorithm types, but the structure still need to be improved and it is possible that some of them are put in wrong places.

Feel free to raise issues if you find the solution is wrong or explantion does not make sense such that we can improve together.

More works come in the future and coding never dies.
