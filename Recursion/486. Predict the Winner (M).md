## 486. Predict the Winner (M)

You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,233,7]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
```

### Solution - Recusion with Memorization

The score of Player 2 can be calculated afterwards by noting that both scores must sum the total of the array: `Player_1 + Player_2 = Sum(nums)`.

For each turn of Player_1, we do the following:

1. We consider picking the first or the last element of the (remaining) array separately. Each alternative is assigned a score, according to the rules of step-2.
2. For each alternative in step-1, we consider that Player 2 is smart and will leave us with the worst possible score afterwards. So, from the 2 upcoming turns (with Player 2 picking his/her first or last element), we consider that we achieve the **minimum** score from these possibilities.
3. After using the previous rules, we pick the **best** score from the 2 alternatives described in (1).
4. Steps (1-3) are repeated recursively until we reach an answer. We use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def PredictTheWinner(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        n = len(nums)
        memo = {}
        sum1 = self.getMaxScore(nums, 0, n-1, memo)
        return True if sum1 >= (sum(nums) - sum1) else False
        
    def getMaxScore(self, nums, i, j, memo):
        if (i, j) in memo:
            return memo[(i, j)]

        if i > j:
            return 0

        sa = nums[i] + min(self.getMaxScore(nums, i+1, j-1, memo), self.getMaxScore(nums, i+2, j, memo))
        sb = nums[j] + min(self.getMaxScore(nums, i, j-2, memo), self.getMaxScore(nums, i+1, j-1, memo))
        score = max(sa, sb)
        memo[(i, j)] = score
        return score
```
