## 16 - 3Sum Closest (M) - Two Pointers

Given an array `nums` of *n* integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Sort the number so that we can use two pointers
        nums.sort()
        result = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]
        distance = abs(result - target)
        
        for i in range(len(nums) -2):
            # Pass the visited same number
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            # Define the left pointer and right pointer
            l, r = i+1, len(nums) - 1

            while l < r:
                sums = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if sums == target:
                    return sums

                temp = abs(sums - target)

                # Move the pointers
                # If the sum is smaller than the target, means we need to increase the sum,
                # So move the left pointer to the right
                # Otherwise, move the right pointer to the left
                if sums < target:
                    l += 1
                elif sums > target:
                    r -= 1
        return result
