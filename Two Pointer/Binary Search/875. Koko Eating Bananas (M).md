## 875. Koko Eating Bananas (M) - Binary Search

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return *the minimum integer* `k` *such that she can eat all the bananas within* `h` *hours*.

Example:

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= piles.length <= 104`
- `piles.length <= h <= 109`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 109`

### Solution - Binary Search

Use the binary earch to find the interger K. Lower bound is 1, upper bound is `max(piles)`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles, h):
        """
        :type piles: List[int]
        :type h: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # binary search, lower bound is 1, upper bound is max(piles)
        left, right = 1, max(piles)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if self.satisfy(piles, mid, h):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1 
        return left

    def satisfy(self, piles, num, h):
        count = 0
        for pile in piles:
            count += math.ceil(pile / float(num))
        return count <= h
```
