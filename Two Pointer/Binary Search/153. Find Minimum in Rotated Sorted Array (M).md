## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (M) - Binary Search

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.



### Solution - Binary Search O(logN)

A very brute way of solving this question is to search the entire array and find the minimum element. The time complexity for that would be O(N) given that `N` is the size of the array.

The efficient way of solving this problem is using the `Binary Search` algorithm. In binary search we find out the mid point and decide to either search on the left or right depending on some condition.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        if nums[left] < nums[right]:
            return nums[left]
        
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            # The minimum is at the [left, mid]
            if nums[mid] < nums[right]:
                right = mid
            # The minimum is at the (mid, right]
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return nums[left]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity : Same as Binary Search O(log⁡N)
- Space Complexity : O(1)
