## 240 

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an *m* x *n* matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

```
[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]

Given target = 5, return true
Given target = 20, return false.
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        # # Brute Force
        # # Time Complexity: O(nm)

        # return False
    
    
        # Second Solution
        # Start the pointer in the top-right
        # Time Complexity: O(n+m)
        # Because row can only be decremented mm times and col can only be incremented n times before causing the while loop to terminate,
        # the loop cannot run for more than n+m iterations.

          	return False
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
