## 1229. Meeting Scheduler (M)

Given the availability time slots arrays `slots1` and `slots2` of two people and a meeting duration `duration`, return the **earliest time slot** that works for both of them and is of duration `duration`.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an **empty array**.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements `[start, end]` representing an inclusive time range from `start` to `end`.

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots `[start1, end1]` and `[start2, end2]` of the same person, either `start1 > end2` or `start2 > end1`.

**Example :**

```
Input: slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 8
Output: [60,68]
```



### Solution - Two Pointer

- Sort two time slots
- Use a pointer for each time slot and track the start time and end time.
- Get the intersection and check if the intersection is larger than duration

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minAvailableDuration(self, slots1, slots2, duration):
        """
        :type slots1: List[List[int]]
        :type slots2: List[List[int]]
        :type duration: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        slots1.sort()
        slots2.sort()

        p1, p2 = 0, 0

        while p1 < len(slots1) and p2 < len(slots2):
            # find the boundaries of the intersection, or the common slot
            intersect_left = max(slots1[p1][0], slots2[p2][0])
            intersect_right = min(slots1[p1][1], slots2[p2][1])

            if intersect_right - intersect_left >= duration:
                return [intersect_left, intersect_left +duration]
            # always move the one that ends earlier
            if slots1[p1][1] <= slots2[p2][1]:
                p1 += 1
            else:
                p2 += 1
        return []

```
