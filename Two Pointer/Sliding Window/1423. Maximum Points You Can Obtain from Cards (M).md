## 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards (M)

There are several cards **arranged in a row**, and each card has an associated number of points The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints`.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the *maximum score* you can obtain.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.
```



### Sliding Window

因为最终我们要获取长度为k的array，那么剩余的数字长度则为`n-k`。所以问题可以转化为用一个长`n-k`的window，找到该window使得，`totalPoints-sumofCurrentWindow`是最大的。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxScore(self, cardPoints, k):
        """
        :type cardPoints: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(cardPoints)        
        left = 0
        total_points = sum(cardPoints)
        cur_sum = 0
        result = 0
        for right in range(n):
            cur_sum += cardPoints[right]
            
            while left <= left and right - left + 1 > n - k:
                cur_sum -= cardPoints[left]
                left += 1
                
            if right - left + 1 == n - k:
                result = max(result, total_points - cur_sum)
        
        return result
```
