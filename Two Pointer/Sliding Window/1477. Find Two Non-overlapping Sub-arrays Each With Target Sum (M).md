## 1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum (M)

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return *the minimum sum of the lengths* of the two required sub-arrays, or return ***-1*** if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```



### 思路：

这个题比较特殊，用到了 Two Pointer (Sliding Window) 的思想，也用到了前缀型之划分型动归的思想。

Let's create two arrays prefix and suffix where `prefix[i]` is the minimum length of sub-array **ends** before i and has sum = k, `suffix[i]` is the minimum length of sub-array **starting** **at** or after i and has sum = k.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minSumOfLengths(self, arr, target):
        """
        :type arr: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        # Use left_sum[i] to represent for the minimum length of the array ends at i whose sum is target
        # Use sliding window method to check the array
        left_sum = [float('inf')] * len(arr)
        left = 0
        
        cur_sum = 0
        min_len = float('inf')
        for right in range(len(arr)):
            cur_sum += arr[right]
            
            while left < right and cur_sum > target:
                cur_sum -= arr[left]
                left += 1

            if cur_sum == target:
                min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
            
            left_sum[right] = min_len
        
        # we also need to find the minimum length of the array starts at i whose sum is target.
        # Also use sliding window method, but starting from the tail    
        result = float('inf')
        right = len(arr) - 1
        
        cur_sum = 0
        min_len = float('inf')
        for left in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
            
            if left_sum[left - 1] == float('inf'):
                continue
            
            cur_sum += arr[left]
            
            while right > left and cur_sum > target:
                cur_sum -= arr[right]
                right -= 1
            
            if cur_sum == target:
                min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
                result = min(result, left_sum[left - 1] + min_len)
                 
        return result if result != float('inf') else -1
```
