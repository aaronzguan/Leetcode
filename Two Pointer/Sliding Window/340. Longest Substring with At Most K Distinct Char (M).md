## 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters (M)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most *k* distinct characters.

```
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

**思路 - Sliding Window:**

1. Define a **left** and **right** pointers to represent the window. 
2. Increment the right pointer and count the number of distinct characters inside the window. 
3. If the number of distinct characters is **larger than K**, increment the left pointer to shrink the window **until** the number of distinct character inside the window is less than or equal to K.
4. The window size is the length of the substring

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        char_count = {}
        longest = 0
        left = 0
        for right in range(len(s)):
            char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1
            while len(char_count) > k:
                char_count[s[left]] -= 1
                if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                    del char_count[s[left]]
                left += 1
                
            longest = max(longest, right - left + 1)
            
        return longest
```
