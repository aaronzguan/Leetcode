## 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element (M)

The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

Return *the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most*** `k` *operations*.

```
Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.
```



### 思路：排序＋滑动窗口

需要**sort**，我们可以得到一个递增的数列

考虑一个窗口，当前窗口最大值乘窗口大小一定要小于等于所有数的和并加上K，才满足增加at most K所有的数变成最大的数，那么当前窗口的大小即frequency．

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxFrequency(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        result = 0
        nums.sort()
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            k += nums[right] # 计算区间和并加上K
            if k < nums[right] * (right - left + 1):
                k -= nums[left]
                left += 1
                
            result = max(result, right - left + 1)
        return result
            
```
