## 324. Wiggle Sort II (M)

Given an integer array `nums`, reorder it such that `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...`.

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

**Follow Up:** Can you do it in `O(n)` time and/or **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?

Example:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,1,1,6,4]
Output: [1,6,1,5,1,4]
Explanation: [1,4,1,5,1,6] is also accepted.
```
