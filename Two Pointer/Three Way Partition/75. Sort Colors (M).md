## 75. Sort Colors (M) - 三分法

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```



### Solution - Three Way Partition 

The problem is known as [Dutch National Flag Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem) and first was proposed by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra). The idea is to attribute a color to each number and then to arrange them following the order of colors on the Dutch flag.

Let's use here three pointers:

1. `left`: track the rightmost boundary of zeros, 
2. `right`: track the leftmost boundary of twos
3. `cur`: the current element under the consideration. 

The idea of solution is to move `curr` pointer along the array, if `nums[curr] = 0` - swap it with `nums[left]`, if `nums[curr] = 2` - swap it with `nums[right]`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        cur = 0
        while cur <= right:
            if nums[cur] == 0:
                nums[left], nums[cur] = nums[cur], nums[left]
                left += 1
                cur += 1
            elif nums[cur] == 2:
                nums[right], nums[cur] = nums[cur], nums[right]
                right -= 1
            else:
                cur += 1
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time complexity : O(N) since it's one pass along the array of length N.
- Space complexity : O(1) since it's a constant space solution.
