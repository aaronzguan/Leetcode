## 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick (H)

Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length **6** is labelled as follows:

Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return *the minimum total cost* of the cuts.

```
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.

Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

### 区间型动态规划：

与 [1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones (H).md](1000.%20Minimum%20Cost%20to%20Merge%20Stones%20(H).md) 类似，该题要求cut stick的minimum cost，可以转化为把所有切开的stick merge在一起的minimum cost: Instead of considering the cost to cut, we can transform the problem to the cost to stick all sticks.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minCost(self, n, cuts):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type cuts: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(cuts) == 1:
            return n
        
        cuts = sorted(cuts)
        sticks = []
        for i, cut in enumerate(cuts):
            if i == 0:
                sticks.append(cuts[i])
            elif i == len(cuts) - 1:
                sticks.append(cuts[i] - cuts[i-1])
                sticks.append(n - cuts[i])
            else:
                sticks.append(cuts[i] - cuts[i-1])
                
        range_sum = self.get_range_sum(sticks)
        N = len(sticks)
        dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
        
        for length in range(2, N + 1):
            for i in range(N - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                for k in range(i, j):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + range_sum[i][j])
                    
        return dp[0][-1]

    def get_range_sum(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        range_sum = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            range_sum[i][i] = nums[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                range_sum[i][j] = range_sum[i][j-1] + nums[j]
        return range_sum
