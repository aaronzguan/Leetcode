## 5 - Longest Paindromic Substring (M) 最长回文子串

Given a string **s**, find the longest palindromic (回文的) substring in **s**. You may assume that the maximum length of **s** is 1000.

```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

### Solution 1: Brute Force:

Obvious solution is to pick all possible starting and ending positions for a substring, and verify if it is a palindrome, which can take O(n). 

* Time complexity: O(n^3^)
* Space complexity: O(1)

### Solution 2: Expanding around center:

We observe that a palindrome mirrors around its center. Therefore, a palindrome can be expanded from its center, and there are only 2*n*−1 such centers.

Why there are 2n - 1 but not n centers? The reason is the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters. Such palindromes have even number of letters (such as "abba") and its center are between the two 'b's.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        result = ""
        # Move the center of substring 'i' from left to right
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # odd case -> "babad" -> "aba"
            temp = self._getLongestPalindromeFrom(s, i, i)
            if len(temp) > len(result):
                result = temp
            # odd case -> "cbbd" -> "bb" 
            temp = self._getLongestPalindromeFrom(s, i, i+1)
            if len(temp) > len(result):
                result = temp
        return result
      
    def _getLongestPalindromeFrom(self, s, leftIdx, rightIdx):
      	"""
      	Check if the string is Palindrome starting in the middle
      	"""
        while leftIdx >= 0 and rightIdx < len(s) and s[leftIdx] == s[rightIdx]:
            leftIdx -= 1
            rightIdx += 1
        return s[leftIdx +1: rightIdx]
```

* Time Complexity: O(n^2^), since expanding a palindrome around its center could take O(n) time, the overall complexity is O(n^2^).
* Space Complexity: O(1)

### Solution 3: DP: 区间型动态规划

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        """
        区间型动态规划
        """
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = True
        
        start = 0
        max_len = 1
        # 考虑长度为2的回文子串
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                dp[i][i+1] = True
                max_len = 2
                start = i
        # 区间型动态规划，由长度开始
        for length in range(3, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = True
                    if length > max_len:
                        max_len = length
                        start = i
        
        return s[start: start + max_len]
```
