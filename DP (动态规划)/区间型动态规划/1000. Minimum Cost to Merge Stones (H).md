## 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones (H)

There are `N` piles of stones arranged in a row. The `i`-th pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A *move* consists of merging **exactly `K` consecutive** piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `K` piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

```
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: 
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.
```

### 思路：区间型动态规划

先判断数组长度与K的关系：满足(N - 1) % (K - 1)  == 0 才能最后合并成功。

```python
class Solution(object):
    def mergeStones(self, stones, K):
        """
        :type stones: List[int]
        :type K: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(stones)
        if (n - 1) % (K - 1) != 0:
            return -1
        
        range_sum = self.get_range_sum(stones)
        
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for length in range(K, n + 1):
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                for k in range(i, j, K - 1):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])
                # 若该区间可以merge为1个石头，那么需要加上这次合并代价，即i到j的和
                if (j - i) % (K - 1) == 0:
                    dp[i][j] += range_sum[i][j]
                    
        return dp[0][-1]
    
    def get_range_sum(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        range_sum = [[0] * n for i in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(n):
            range_sum[i][i] = nums[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                range_sum[i][j] = range_sum[i][j - 1] + nums[j]
        return range_sum
```
