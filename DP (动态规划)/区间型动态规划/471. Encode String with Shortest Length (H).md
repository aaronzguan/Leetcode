## 471. Encode String with Shortest Length (H)

Given a **non-empty** string, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.

The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times.

**Note:**

1. `k` will be a positive integer.
2. If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there are several solutions, return **any of them**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: "aaa"
Explanation: There is no way to encode it such that it is shorter than the input string, so we do not encode it.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaaaa"
Output: "5[a]"
Explanation: "5[a]" is shorter than "aaaaa" by 1 character.
```
