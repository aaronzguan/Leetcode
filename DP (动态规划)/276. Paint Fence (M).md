## 276. Paint Fence (M)

You are painting a fence of `n` posts with `k` different colors. You must paint the posts following these rules:

- Every post must be painted **exactly one** color.
- There **cannot** be three or more **consecutive** posts with the same color.

Given the two integers `n` and `k`, return *the **number of ways** you can paint the fence*.



**Example:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: All the possibilities are shown.
Note that painting all the posts red or all the posts green is invalid because there cannot be three posts in a row with the same color.
```



### Solution - DP

`dp[i]=(k-1)*(dp[i-1]+dp[i-2])`

- `dp[i-1]*(k-1)`代表当前格子的颜色和前一个不同的方案 
- `dp[i-2]*(k-1)`代表当前格子的颜色和前一个相同的方案

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numWays(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n == 1:
            return k
        dp = [[0] * k for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[1] = k
        dp[2] = k * k
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            dp[i] = (k - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
        return dp[-1]
```
