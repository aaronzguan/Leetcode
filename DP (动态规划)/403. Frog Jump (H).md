## 403. Frog Jump (H)

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted **ascending** order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was ***k*** units, then its next jump must be either ***k* - 1, *k*,** or ***k* + 1** units. **Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.**

**Example 1:**

```
[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

There are a total of 8 stones.
The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
The last stone at the 17th unit.

Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
```

**Example 2:**

```
[0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]

Return false. There is no way to jump to the last stone as 
the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
```

**思想：只能向前走->有固定方向的->动态规划**

用hashmap，对于{stone:step}存储石头的位置和step的集合

对于每块石头，已知跳到这里用了step步，那么就看从该位置跳step-1, step, 和step+1能不能跳到新的石头，若可以，在新的石头value处加入这个步数

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCross(self, stones):
        """
        :type stones: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # Corner case
        if len(stones) <= 1:
            return True
        if not (stones[0] == 0 and stones[1] == 1):
            return False
        dp = {}
        for stone in stones:
            dp[stone] = set()
        dp[0].add(1)
        
        for stone in stones:
            for step in dp[stone]:
                if stone + step + 1 in dp:
                    dp[stone + step + 1].add(step + 1)
                if stone + step in dp:
                    dp[stone + step].add(step)
                if step > 1 and stone + step - 1 in dp:
                    dp[stone + step - 1].add(step - 1)
        return len(dp[stones[-1]]) > 0
```

用set(stone, k)记录已访问过的点并且到达该点的步长为K，避免重复

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCross(self, stones):
        """
        :type stones: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        valid_stone = set(stones)
        if 1 not in valid_stone:
            return False
        return self.helper(1, 1, valid_stone, stones[-1], set())
        
    def helper(self, cur_stone, last_jump, valid_stone, target_stone, visited):
        if cur_stone == target_stone:
            return True
        if cur_stone not in valid_stone:
            return False
        # for all possible jumps
        for jump in (last_jump-1, last_jump, last_jump+1):
            next_stone = cur_stone+jump
            if jump > 0 and (next_stone, jump) not in visited:
                visited.add((next_stone, jump))
                if self.helper(next_stone, jump, valid_stone, target_stone, visited):
                    return True                
        return False
```

### 3. BFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCross(self, stones):
        if not stones:
            return False
        stone_set = set(stones)
        
        queue = collections.deque()
        visited = set()
        queue.append((0, 0))
        visited.add((0, 0))
        
        while queue:
            stone, step = queue.popleft()
            if stone == stones[-1]:
                return True
            
            for next_step in (step - 1, step, step + 1):
                if next_step > 0 and (stone + next_step, next_step) not in visited and stone + next_step in stone_set:
                    visited.add((stone + next_step, next_step))
                    queue.append((stone + next_step, next_step))
                    
        return False
```
