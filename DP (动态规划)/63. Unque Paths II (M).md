## 63. Unique Paths II (M) (不同路径)

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be? 网格中的障碍物和空位置分别用1和0来表示

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**有方向性并且求方案总数 -> DP**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid):
        """
        :type obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not obstacleGrid:
            return None
        n, m = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        
        dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
        # 初始化第一行，第一列，第一行只能往右走，第一列只能往下走
        for i in range(n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1:
                break
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(m):
            if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 1:
                break
            dp[0][j] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
