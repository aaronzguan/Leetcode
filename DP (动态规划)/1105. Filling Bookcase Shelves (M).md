## 1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves (M) - 2D Knapsack

You are given an array `books` where `books[i] = [thicknessi, heighti]` indicates the thickness and height of the `ith` book. You are also given an integer `shelfWidth`.

We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width `shelfWidth`.

We choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less than or equal to `shelfWidth`, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down. We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.

- For example, if we have an ordered list of `5` books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

Return *the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner*.



**Example:**

```
Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.
```



### Solution: Bottom-UP DP

**Intuition: For each book, we need to explore two cases: add to the current shelf (if it fits), or start a new shelf.**

- `dp[i]`: Minimum height sum for the first `i` books

- Given the `i`th book, we just need to decide whether

  - It's gonna be on its own row, or
  - Append to some previous row

  

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minHeightShelves(self, books, shelfWidth):
        """
        :type books: List[List[int]]
        :type shelfWidth: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp = [float('inf')] * len(books)
        dp[0] = books[0][1]
        for i in range(1, len(books)):
            cur_w, max_h = books[i][0], books[i][1]
            # initialize result for current book `dp[i]`
            # assume it will be put on the new shelf initially
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + max_h 
            for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
                # Put the Jth book together with the current book on the same shelf
                cur_w += books[j][0]
                # Update current max height
                max_h = max(max_h, books[j][1])
                if cur_w <= shelfWidth: 
                    # put the jth book with the current book such that the possible height would be (minimum height sum of previous h-1 books + current max height)
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + max_h if j > 0 else max_h) 
                else:
                    break
        return dp[-1]
```
