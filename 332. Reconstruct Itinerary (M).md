## 332 - Graph / Backtracking

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.

**Note:**

1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should **return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order** when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
2. You may assume all tickets **form at least one valid itinerary**.

```
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```

#### Method 1 - Graph

This method takes advantage of the assumption that all tickets can form at least one valid itinerary.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findItinerary(self, tickets):
        """
        :type tickets: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        target = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for ticket in tickets:
            target[ticket[0]].append(ticket[1])
        
        route = []
        def visit(airport):
            while target[airport]:
                # sort the targets in lexical order but then reverse the order so that pop will get the one with highest lexical order
                target[airport] = sorted(target[airport])[::-1]
                visit(target[airport].pop())
            route.append(airport)
        
        visit('JFK')
        return route[::-1]
```



#### Method 2 - DFS with Backtracking

```python
    def findItinerary(self, tickets):
        """
        Second Solution: DFS with Backtracking
        """
        targets = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for ticket in tickets:
            targets[ticket[0]].append(ticket[1])
        
        route = ['JFK']
        
        def dfs(start):
            # the route is finished and succesful
            if len(route) == len(tickets) +1:
                return route
            
            myDst = sorted(targets[start])
            
            for dst in myDst:
                route.append(dst)
                targets[start].remove(dst)
                worked = dfs(dst)
                if worked:
                    return route
                # backtracking
                route.pop()
                targets[start].append(dst)
                
        return dfs('JFK')
```
