## 1776. Car Fleet II (M)

There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:

- `positioni` is the distance between the `ith` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.
- `speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the **slowest** car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answers are accepted.

Example:

```
Input: cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.
```



### Solution - Stack

-  **Iterate from the last to the first car**. 
- Maintain a stack of car indices, where their collision time is strict decreasing from the last to the first. 即从左往右依次撞到前车。若前车先撞 后车再撞，那么后車撞的时间应该基于前车撞后的新速度 （即前前车的速度）重新计算

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getCollisionTimes(self, cars):
        """
        :type cars: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[float]
        """
        stack = []
        # res stores the collision time for each car
        res = [-1] * len(cars)

        for i in range(len(cars) - 1, -1, -1):
            pos, speed = cars[i]
            while stack and not self.collision(cars[stack[-1]], cars[i], res[stack[-1]]):
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                res[i] = float(cars[stack[-1]][0] - pos) / (speed - cars[stack[-1]][1])
            stack.append(i)
        return res
    
    def collision(self, frontCar, backCar, frontCarCollideTime):
        # return true/false based on if a will collide with b or not
        if frontCar[1] >= backCar[1]:
            return False
        
        collide_time = float(frontCar[0] - backCar[0]) / (backCar[1] - frontCar[1])

        if collide_time >= frontCarCollideTime and frontCarCollideTime != -1:
            # the frontcar, by the time i reach it would already have collided to some other. Although we will collide, but since its too late collision we dont need this one
            return False 
        
        return True
```
