## 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence (M)

Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return *the most **competitive** subsequence of* `nums` *of size* `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more **competitive** than a subsequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number **less** than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[1,3,4]` is more competitive than `[1,3,5]` because the first position they differ is at the final number, and `4` is less than `5`.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]
Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
```



### Solution - Stack O(N)

- Keep a mono increasing stack result
- If current element `num` is smaller than the last element in the stack, we can replace it to get a smaller sequence
- Before we do this, we have to check if we still have already deleted enough elements. If we have already deleted enough elements, we cannot replace the last elment in the stack, instead we can only append the `num`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def mostCompetitive(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        stack = []
        to_delete = len(nums) - k
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            while stack and num < stack[-1] and to_delete > 0:
                stack.pop()
                to_delete -= 1
                
            stack.append(num)

        return stack[:-to_delete] if to_delete else stack
```
