## 402. Remove K Digits (M)

Given string num representing a non-negative integer `num`, and an integer `k`, return *the smallest possible integer after removing* `k` *digits from* `num`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
```



### Solution - Stack 

Exactly same as [1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence (M).md](1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence (M).md)

-  Construct a mon increasing sequence of digits
- If current element `digit` is smaller than the last element in the stack, we can replace it to get a smaller sequence
- Before we do this, we have to check if we still have already deleted enough elements. If we have already deleted enough elements, we cannot replace the last elment in the stack, instead we can only append the `digit`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeKdigits(self, num, k):
        """
        :type num: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        if len(num) == k:
            return "0"
        new_length = len(num) - k
        stack = []
        for i, digit in enumerate(num):
            while stack and int(digit) < int(stack[-1]) and k > 0:
                stack.pop()
                k -= 1
            stack.append(digit)

         # - Trunk the remaining digits at the end such that the num of removing digit is k
        return str(int("".join(stack[:-k] if k else stack)))
```
