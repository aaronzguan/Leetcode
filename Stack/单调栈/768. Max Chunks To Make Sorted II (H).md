## 768. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II (H)

You are given an integer array `arr`.

We split `arr` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return *the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array*.

**Example:**

```
Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3, 4, 4].
However, splitting into [2, 1], [3], [4], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```



### Solution:

**The max number in every chunk should be <= than the max number in the following chunk.** Thus, we can maintain the max number of each chunk in the stack, which will be monotonic non-decreasing stack

- So, we can loop through the array and maintain a stack. Each element in the stack represents a chunk.
- Each time we encounter a `num[i]` that is bigger than or equal to the previous chunk max, we push it to the stack. If we encounter a smaller number, we must combine this number with the previous chunks. We do this by comparing with the top chunk in the stack and popping them off until we encounter a chunk with max number that is smaller than `num[i]`.
- Then, we update the new combined chunk with the new max by pushing it back onto the stack. The number of elements in this stack at the end is the number of chunks.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxChunksToSorted(self, arr):
        """
        :type arr: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack = []
        for num in arr:
            if not stack or stack[-1] <= num:
                stack.append(num)
            else:
                cur_max = 0
                while stack and num < stack[-1]:
                    cur_max = max(cur_max, stack.pop())
                stack.append(cur_max)
        return len(stack)
```

Time Complexity: O(N)
