## 739. Daily Tempratures (M) - Stack

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

给定一个数组，返回每个对应位置右边第一个比他大的数的距离

```python
def dailyTemperatures(T):
	"""
	:type T: List[int]
	:rtype: List[int]
	"""
	length = len(T)
	ans = [0]*length
	stack = []

	for i in range(length):
		while stack and T[i] > T[stack[-1]]:
			prev_index = stack.pop()
			ans[prev_index] = i - prev_index # 返回距离
			# ans[prev_index] = T[i] # 返回数字
		stack.append(i)

	return ans
```
