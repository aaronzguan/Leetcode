## 85. Maximal Rectangle (H)

Given a `rows x cols` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s and return *its area*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
```



### Solution:

- 算出每一行的的每一列上方有多少连续的1
- 再把每一行看做Histogram, 按 [85.Maximal Rectangle](84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram (H).md) 算出这一行能形成的最大矩形

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        heights = [[0] * len(matrix[0]) for _ in range(len(matrix))]

        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                if i == 0 and matrix[i][j] == "1":
                    heights[i][j] = 1
                elif matrix[i][j] == "1":
                    heights[i][j] = heights[i-1][j] + 1

        max_area = 0
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            max_area = max(max_area, self.getMaxRectangle(heights[i]))
        return max_area
    
    def getMaxRectangle(self, heights):
        heights = heights + [0]
        max_area = 0
        stack = []
        for right, height in enumerate(heights):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > height:
                h = heights[stack.pop()]
                left = stack[-1] if stack else -1
                w = right - left - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, h*w)
            stack.append(right)

        return max_area
```
