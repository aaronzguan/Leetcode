## 2289. Steps to Make Array Non-decreasing (M) - Stack

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one step, **remove** all elements `nums[i]` where `nums[i - 1] > nums[i]` for all `0 < i < nums.length`.

Return *the number of steps performed until* `nums` *becomes a **non-decreasing** array*.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11]
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the steps performed:
- Step 1: [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11] becomes [5,4,4,7,6,11,11]
- Step 2: [5,4,4,7,6,11,11] becomes [5,4,7,11,11]
- Step 3: [5,4,7,11,11] becomes [5,7,11,11]
[5,7,11,11] is a non-decreasing array. Therefore, we return 3.
```



### Solution 1 - Iterating Backward

Iterating the input `nums backward, then for each `nums [i]`, find how many round it can eat on its right.

`dp[i]` means the number of element `nums[i]` can eat on its right. More precisely, the number of rounds for an element `nums[i]`,
to completely eat whatever it can eat on the right of `nums[i]`, if it is possible.

Iterative input array `nums` reversely, If `nums[i]` is bigger the last element `nums[j]` of stack,
this means `nums[i]` can eat that element, Then update `dp[i]` to be max of `dp[i] + 1` and `dp[j]`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def totalSteps(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp = [0] * len(nums)
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
      		# can eat the last element in the stack
            while stack and nums[i] > nums[stack[-1]]:
                j = stack.pop()
                dp[i] = max(dp[i] + 1, dp[j])
            stack.append(i)
        return max(dp)
```

Time complexity: `O(n)`
Space complexity:  `O(n)`



### Solution 2 - Iterating Forward

For each `A[i]`, we need to find how many round it takes to be eaten.

We can maintain a monotonic decreasing stack, and traverse the array from left to right. For each newly added number `nums[i]`, we need to:

> remove the top number from stack that is no larger than `nums[i]`, and record the maximum step number from these popped numbers.

Until we find the first number that is larger than `nums[i]`, meaning `nums[i]` will be removed 'by' this number in some step, and this step number equals the maximum step number we removed plus 1.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def totalSteps(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp = [0] * len(nums)
        stack = []
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            step = 0
            while stack and num >= nums[stack[-1]]:
                step = max(step, dp[stack.pop()])
            
            # 若stack 不为空，则该数会被stack里last element吃掉
            # update nums[i] 被吃掉所需要的step
            if stack:
                dp[i] = step + 1
            stack.append(i)
        return max(dp)
```
