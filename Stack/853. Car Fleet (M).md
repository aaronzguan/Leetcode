## 853. Car Fleet (M)

There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the `ith` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper **at the same speed**. The faster car will **slow down** to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A **car fleet** is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return *the **number of car fleets** that will arrive at the destination*.

Example :

```
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
```



### Solution - Stack

- Sort cars by the start positions
- Loop on each car **from the end to the beginning**. 按位置从后往前遍历
- Calculate its `time` needed to arrive at the `target`
- `cur` records the current biggest `time`, which means the slowest
  - If another car needs less or equal time than `cur`, it can catch up this car fleet.
  - If another car needs more time, it will be the new slowest car, and becomes the new lead of a car fleet.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def carFleet(self, target, position, speed):
        """
        :type target: int
        :type position: List[int]
        :type speed: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack = []
        for pos, vel in sorted(zip(position, speed))[::-1]:
            time = float(target - pos) / vel
            if not stack:
                stack.append(time)
            elif time > stack[-1]:
                stack.append(time)
       	return len(stack)
```
