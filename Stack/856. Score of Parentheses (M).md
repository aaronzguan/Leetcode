## 856. Score of Parentheses (M)

Given a balanced parentheses string `s`, return *the **score** of the string*.

The **score** of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:

- `"()"` has score `1`.
- `AB` has score `A + B`, where `A` and `B` are balanced parentheses strings.
- `(A)` has score `2 * A`, where `A` is a balanced parentheses string.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2
```



### Solution 1 - Stack

Our goal is to maintain the score at the current depth we are on. When we see an opening bracket, we increase our depth, and our score at the new depth is 0. When we see a closing bracket, we add twice the score of the previous deeper part

- see a `(`：`stack.push(0)` to increase our depth
- see a `)` ：we need to decrease our depth
  - `int v = stack.pop();` score of the ith depth
  - `int w = stack.pop();` score of the（i-1)th depth
  - `stack.push(w + Math.max(2 * v, 1));` collect a new score for the（i-1)th depth

a final score is collected for the 0th depth, so `return stack.pop();`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def scoreOfParentheses(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        stack  = [0]
        for i in s:
            if i == "(":
                stack.append(0)
            else:
                cur = stack.pop()
                prev = stack.pop()
                stack.append(prev + max(2*cur, 1))
        return stack[-1]
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of `S`.
- Space Complexity: O(N), the size of the stack.

### Solution 2 - Divide and Conquer

Split the string into `S = A + B` where `A` and `B` are balanced parentheses strings, and `A` is the smallest possible non-empty prefix of `S`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def scoreOfParentheses(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        return self.getScore(0, len(s), s)
    
    def getScore(self, start, end, s):
        ans = bal = 0
        for i in range(start, end):
            if s[i] == "(":
                bal += 1
            else:
                bal -= 1
            
            if bal == 0:
                if i - start == 1:
                    ans += 1
                else:
                    ans += 2 * self.getScore(start + 1, i, s)
                start = i + 1
        return ans
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(N^2^), where N is the length of `S`. An example worst case is `(((((((....)))))))`.
- Space Complexity: O(N), the size of the implied call stack.
